# Data Science from Scratch with Golang

Welcome to the **Data Science from Scratch with Golang** repository! This project aims to implement essential data science concepts, algorithms, and workflows **from scratch** using the Go programming language (Golang). The repository serves as an educational tool for those interested in understanding the fundamental mechanics of data science without relying on high-level libraries.



## Objectives

- **Understand the Fundamentals**: Provide an in-depth understanding of key data science concepts by building them step-by-step from scratch.
- **Leverage Golang's Strengths**: Use Golang for its performance, simplicity, and strong support for concurrency.
- **Learn by Doing**: Offer an opportunity for developers to build algorithms and techniques manually, gaining a stronger grasp of the underlying principles.



## Features

- **Core Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Linear algebra operations (vectors, matrices, dot products, etc.)
  - Statistical computations (mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.)
  - Probability functions and distributions

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Data normalization and standardization
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature encoding

- **Algorithms and Models**:
  - Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression)
  - Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression)
  - Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)
  - Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., Principal Component Analysis)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Confusion Matrix

- **Visualization Utilities** (optional):
  - Basic ASCII-based data visualizations (if feasible in Go).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go (Golang)**: Install the latest version of Go from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-with-golang.git
   cd data-science-with-golang
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

### Running the Code

Run specific modules using the `go run` command. For example:
```bash
go run algorithms/regression/linear_regression.go
```

### Running Tests

Unit tests are available in the `tests` directory. Run all tests using:
```bash
go test ./...
```
